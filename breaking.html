I was once a vegetarian and also a animal rights activist. It all started when a friend who was and by the time I wrote this still a vegan introduced me to animal rights and the benefits of not eating meat and other food derived from an animal.   This was early 2014, and I was not aware of Rothbard's NAP which is my ethincal source (despite being an anarchist already). After watching a Gary Yourofsky's speech, I was convinced to vegetarianism. <br>
This bought me a lot of good things: my family did not like the idea, so I learnt how to cook vegetarian meals. My health was perfect: I went to blood tests every 3 months and every single one of them indicated every component (like vitamins) was in good dosage. I haven't felt physically tired or sick a single day of my 4 year period. I started hanging out with friends who followed that trend too, and I met a lot of good people within the movement. <br>
So, in mid 2016 I met Rothbard's NAP. And by 2017 I was already a anarcho-capitalist who didn't believe in animal rights no more. And the flaw in that theory is simple: animals do not possess the ability to reason and do not possess a conscience. <br>
But this alone haven't made me stop eating meat: there was pride. I felt like I couldn't simple made that transition because people around criticized me all those years for my choice and being a vegetarian holded some kind of pride: it involved a fight against my emotions and addictions. I broke a habit, so I stood with my decision proudly all that time.  <br>
In early 2018, coincidentally during a local anarcho-capitalist meet, I ordered a cheese sandwich at a local snack bar. I bit it, and surprisingly there was ham along with cheese. My 4 year streak was broken, and after that day I started eating meat again. <br>
OK, but what about your health? I'm pretty sure meat has something to do with health, especially about your heart, but what made me change was my new routine, which included far more vegetables and healthy food. Before that, I used to eat anything without caution (especially fast-food). <br>
I'm very grateful for being a vegetarian all those years, I learnt a lot of things, and especially about my eating routine that changed drastically. For example, it's been 6 years since I do not eat at fast-food restaurants. I no longer eat meat like I used to do. <br>
Do I recommend it? For sure, it is a nice to change your eating habit: but it's a radical way to do so. You can change without going vegetarian. It's up to you. <br>
