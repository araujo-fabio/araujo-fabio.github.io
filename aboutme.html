        <p> Written by Fabio H. Araujo </p>
    </header>
    <div style="float: left; width: 50%">
        <p> My name is Fabio, and I'm a 17 year old lurker from Sao Paulo, Brazil.      
        </p>
        <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
        <p>
        I don't have a favorite song, food, band or anything for much longer. My tastes don't work that way: I can't judge whether I like The Offspring or Korn better, because I like them in different ways. My mood sometimes will be more in favour of something, but I know that this is going to end sometime. <br>
        But I can say what I like most of the time, and this is what I'm going to write here.
        </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
        Genres I often enjoy are mostly rockish. I'm into Alternative Rock, New Metal, Punk Rock, Deathcore, almost anything rock-based. You can see what I'm hearing in the past days visiting my last.fm page (see Links in the end of this article). <br>
        Linkin Park may be my favorite band of all time: been a fan since a kid, maybe since I was born (I've got pictures with LP t-shirts when I was 1 year old). For me, the band will never get boring, along with side-projects like Fort Minor and Dead by Sunrise. 
        </p>
        <h3> Videogames </h3>
        <p>
        I'm not into videogames, especially newer ones because they look so boring, slow-paced and too much cinematic. I also miss the soul developers put into games - something that was lost when the game industry became so big and artificial. I tend to like games with strategic thinking, or anything with great aesthetics overall. <br>
        My favorite videogames are: Tetris, old-school FPS (Doom, Blood and Duke Nukem 3D), Street Fighter, DotA2, Counter-Strike 1.6, Halo (Bungie era), Starcraft. <br>
        I also own a Steam account for some PC games, and a GameFAQs account so I can track anything I own physically. I most pirate or emulate games, but you can find links to my accounts in the end of this article anyway.
        </p>
        <h3>Politics, philosophy and ativism</h3>
        <p>
        I'm a <a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism"> anarcho-capitalist </a> (or a Libertarian by Brazilian standards, which is nowhere closer to the American standards). I'm also a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html"> cypherpunk </a>, and I'm always learning new ways to free software and ensure privacy.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
        Most of the things I read are relationed to either anarcho-capitalism or cypherpunk topics. Besides that, I enjoy reading Absurdism and Symbolism. 
        </p>
        <h3>How I do my computing</h3>
        <p>
        I use a desktop with some OK specs. I use most than one Linux distro. My main one is currently using Ubuntu (a Debian based distro), but I also have a HDD with Windows installed on it for some purposes. My favorite graphical interface is XFCE. I'm looking foward to buying a Thinkpad.<br>
        I use a Redmi Note 4X phone with a custom Android ROM installed on it. <br>
        I mostly use my computer to storage things such as documents and music. I also use it for some programs that are required in work or studies.
