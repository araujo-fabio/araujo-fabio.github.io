        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        My name is Fabio H. Araujo, a 18 years old living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Started studying programming recently. One of my goals in my HTML and CSS studies are to make a personal blog: and here is it. <br>
		I also use this place to publish things I wrote, manifesting my opinion about certain subjects.

        <h3>Politics, philosophy and ativism</h3>
        <p>
        I'm a <a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism"> anarcho-capitalist </a> (or a Libertarian by Brazilian standards, which is nowhere closer to the American standards). I'm also a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html"> cypherpunk </a>.

        <h3>How I do my computing</h3>
        <p>
		I own a desktop with some low-end specs. My main OS is Ubuntu (a Debian-based distro), although I experienced more than 5 different Linux distros. I also have a Windows 7 installed on a separate HDD, which I use mainly for videogames and some exclusive software. My favorite graphical interface is XFCE. Currently looking foward on buying a Thinkpad. Also own a Redmi Note 4X phone with a custom Android ROM installed. <br>
		I started using computers early, as far I remember at the age of 7 I was already fissured with them. Learned Hardware fixing my own computer and helping friends do the same. Started studying programming at the age of 14 but never took it serious as I am tooking it right now.
